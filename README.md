# WindsAloft-Pwsh

A PowerShell module for interacting with the WindsAloft weather app: https://windsaloft.us/, created by Mark Schulze.

This project is unaffiliated with the WindsAloft project, and exists to provide extended functionality to make accessing the WindsAloft data easier programitically.

Also included is a file linking directly to the winds aloft page for each dropzone the app knows about.
