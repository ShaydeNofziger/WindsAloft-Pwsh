# WindsAloft-Pwsh

A PowerShell module for interacting with the WindsAloft weather app: https://windsaloft.us/, created by Mark Schulze.

This project is unaffiliated with the WindsAloft project, and exists to provide extended functionality to make accessing the WindsAloft data easier programitically.

[This gist](https://gist.github.com/ShaydeNofziger/5b324c91a1b0d93cb17010228041bbb1) contains a list of all DZs from WindsAloft and a link to their WindsAloft page.
